# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Idea 1: Fishing Game
    - Form 1: RPG style fishing game
        - Includes a shop and fishing instructions
        - Start off with basic rod, reel, and worm bait
            - As you catch more fish you earn a currency, and can buy more baits to catch bigger fish
        - Currency can also be used to enter fishing tournaments 
            - Your performance in the tournament can earn you sponsorships, extra currency, or upgraded   gear
    - Form 2: RPG style fishing game with animation
        - This would include everything in Form 1, but there would be animations
            - I would use turtle to draq and have pictures/animations of the user casting out of a boat
            - There would also be cutscenes with images transfering from the shop, tournament, fishing, etc.
    - Form 3: Interactive Animation
        - This would have everything in Form 1 and Form 2, but would have interactive animations
            - For example, the user would be able to move the boat around and pick where to cast. The locations would make a difference as to the probability of catching fish.
