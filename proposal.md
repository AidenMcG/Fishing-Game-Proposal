## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Fishing Tourny Classic

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

RPG style fishing game where the user fishes to earn currency. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

RPG style fishing game where the user starts off with the most basic form of a rod, reel, and bait. The user fishes to earn currency(more currency for bigger fish), which can be used to purchace items in the shop. The shop has different rods, reels, and baits/lures. I am planning to implement fishing tournaments, which will work as levels. These tournaments will reward the user with extra currency and free items when won. (Not one-hundred percent sure if I will be able to do code the tournaments though)

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not Available

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

An RPG fishing game that allows the user to fish and catch different fish.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An RPG fishing game that allows the user to fish, catch different fish, and has an item shop with currency.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An RPG fishing game that allows the user to fish, catch different fish, and has an item shop with currency. There will also be tournaments that will act as levels in the game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will include building the item shop. I have built an item shop in a high school Java class. So I will do something similiar to that, and research different ideas for the shop on the internet. I will also have to code the actual fishing, which I will use random for. Based on the rod, reel, and bait/lure the user is using, there chances of catching bigger fish will increas. I will definitely need to do a lot of research on how to code the tournaments, and how to make them into levels.
